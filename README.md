# Waterhouse-s-Theorem
Waterhouse's classification theorem on Elliptic curves, defined over a finite field

Theorem:    
Let q = p^n be a power of a prime p, a in Z and N = q + 1 - a.
There is an elliptic curve E defined over Fq = Fp^n such that:
#E(Fq) = N iff |a|<= 2sqrt(q) and a satisfies one of the following:   
(1.) gcd(a,p)=1   
(2.) n is even and in addition: (i) a=-+2sqrt(q) or (ii) a=-+sqrt(q) and p!=1mod(3) or (iii) a=0 and p!=1mod(4)   
(3.) n is odd and in addition: (i) a=0 or (ii) a=-+sqrt(pq) and p=2 or p=3
